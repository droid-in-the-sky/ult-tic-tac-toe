The Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe:

A 2-player game played on a game board comprising nine tic-tac-toe games set 
out in nine mini-squares within a 3x3 greater-square.
Thus, there are 81 cells, arranged in nine 3x3 mini-squares within a greater 
square.

Objective:
The objective of this game is to be the first to win three tic-tac-toe games 
lying in a row, column, or diagonal within the greater-square.

Rules of Play:
1.  The first player may place an "X" in any cell within any mini-square on the 
    board.
2.  The selected cell position within this mini-square corresponds
    to the mini-square position within the greater-square where the second 
    player must then place an "O".
3.  Thereafter, the two players take turns placing their mark in any unfilled 
    cell within the mini-square dictated by the cell position marked by the
    previous player.
    For the first player, this mini-square will be outlined in red.
4.  The first tic-tac-toe winner in a mini-square remains the winner in that 
    mini-square for the remainder of the game.
5.  If a player is sent to a mini-square that has already been won, or in which 
    all the cells are already filled, then the player may next place his mark
    in any unfilled cell in any other mini-board.
